Release Branching Strategy
This document outlines the Release Branching Strategy for the project. It ensures a smooth development process by managing the lifecycle of code from initial development to production release. The strategy uses Git flow principles to organize branches and commits.

Branches Overview
1. main (or master)
The main branch represents the stable, production-ready version of the code. All released code that is live or deployed will be in this branch.

Do not push directly to main. Changes are integrated into main via the release or hotfix branches.

2. develop
The develop branch is the integration branch for features. All new features and bug fixes are merged into develop first.

Do not push directly to develop unless it's a minor bug fix that doesn't require a separate feature branch.

3. feature/{feature-name}
Feature branches are used to develop new features for the upcoming release.

These branches should be branched off from develop and should focus solely on one specific feature.

Naming convention: feature/{feature-name} (e.g., feature/login-page).

When a feature is complete, it is merged back into develop.

4. release/{release-version}
A release branch is used for final preparations before a release.

It is created from develop and used for testing, bug fixing, and minor tweaks.

Naming convention: release/{version} (e.g., release/1.0).

After all the release preparation is complete, the branch is merged into both main and develop.

5. hotfix/{hotfix-name}
A hotfix branch is used to quickly patch issues in production.

It is created from main and merged back into both main and develop (or the current release branch).

Naming convention: hotfix/{bug-description} (e.g., hotfix/fix-login-error).

After the hotfix is deployed, the branch is deleted.

Workflow
Creating a New Feature
Create a feature branch from develop:

bash
Копировать
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/feature-name
Work on the feature and commit changes.

Once the feature is complete, merge it into develop:

bash
Копировать
git checkout develop
git merge feature/feature-name
Preparing a Release
Create a release branch from develop when preparing for a new release:

bash
Копировать
git checkout develop
git checkout -b release/{release-version}
Perform final bug fixes, documentation updates, and other release-specific tasks.

Once the release is ready, merge it into both main and develop:

bash
Копировать
git checkout main
git merge release/{release-version}
git checkout develop
git merge release/{release-version}
Hotfixes
Create a hotfix branch from main to fix an urgent issue:

bash
Копировать
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/{hotfix-name}
Once the fix is complete, merge the hotfix into both main and develop:

bash
Копировать
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/{hotfix-name}
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/{hotfix-name}
Branch Management
Merge regularly: Regularly merge changes from develop into your feature branches to keep them up-to-date with the latest code.

Delete branches: Once a feature, release, or hotfix has been merged, delete the branch to maintain a clean Git history.

Visualizing the Branching Strategy
In GitHub, you can visualize the flow of commits and branches using the Network Graph in the Insights tab of your repository. This graph shows how the branches are related and how commits have been integrated into the various branches.

To view the network graph:

Navigate to the repository on GitHub.

Go to the Insights tab.

Click on Network to see the branching structure and commit history.
